# *DATA SCIENCE PROJECT*

In this capstone project, we aim to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than competitors, who charge upwards of $165 million per launch. A major factor in these cost savings is the reusability of the first stage. By accurately predicting whether the first stage will land successfully, we can estimate launch costs. This insight can be valuable for competing companies looking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.


In this process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting.

# *Objectives*

    1) To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and          thus determine the cost of a launch.
    2) Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.
    3) A business report to be shown to relevant stakeholders
