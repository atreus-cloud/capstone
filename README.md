DATA SCIENCE PROJECT

In this capstone project, we aim to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than competitors, who charge upwards of $165 million per launch. A major factor in these cost savings is the reusability of the first stage. By accurately predicting whether the first stage will land successfully, we can estimate launch costs. This insight can be valuable for competing companies looking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.
in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and reporting.
